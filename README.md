# Football Performance Analysis

This project analyzes football performance data with the goal of identifying key patterns and insights from player and team statistics.

## Overview

- Raw data was collected from **FBref.com** and stored in `data/raw/`.
- All data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering were performed in **Jupyter Notebooks** (`notebooks/`).
- The processed datasets (`data/processed/`) represent the final, analysis-ready outputs.

## Notebooks

The notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder contain the full data pipeline, including:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Analysis and visualization

## Data

- **Raw data (`data/raw/`)**: original datasets from FBref, exported as CSV.  
- **Processed data (`data/processed/`)**: cleaned and processed datasets, ready for analysis and reporting.

## Final Report

The complete project report, including all graphs, analysis, and conclusions, is available as a PDF:

> Note: Some pages in the PDF have different dimensions due to layout settings in Looker Studio.
