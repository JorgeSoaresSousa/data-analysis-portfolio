# Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used in the project.

## Purpose

The notebooks handle the full data pipeline:
- Load raw data from the `data/raw` folder
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- Export the final datasets to the `data/processed` folder

## Notes

- All data processing is performed in Jupyter Notebooks.
- The processed datasets generated by these notebooks are used for analysis, dashboards, and the final report.
